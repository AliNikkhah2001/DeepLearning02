# Transfer Learning Approaches for CIFAR-10 Dataset

This notebook implements transfer learning using three different approaches:

1. **Training a Linear Classifier with a Fixed Feature Extractor using Cross-Entropy Loss.**
2. **Fine-tuning the Feature Extractor using Triplet Loss and then Training a Linear Classifier on Top.**
3. **Training the Whole Model in an End-to-End Fashion using both Triplet Loss and Cross-Entropy Loss.**

The code is structured into sections that involve the loading of the CIFAR-10 dataset, filtering it to include only `airplane` and `automobile` classes (0 and 1, respectively), and creating training and testing data loaders with a batch size of `256`.

It's noted that due to the small size of the dataset, no explicit validation set was created initially. However, experimentation revealed that the model's performance degraded without a validation set, and this information will be provided if needed.

### Transfer Learning with Cross-Entropy Loss
The notebook demonstrates the training process using Cross-Entropy Loss. Over the course of 5 epochs, the training loss decreased to 0.3271 and the training accuracy increased to 86.16%. This suggests a fine-tuning process, achieving a final accuracy of 86.16%.

### Training Feature Extractor with Triplet Loss
The notebook also explores training the feature extractor with Triplet Loss and subsequently training a fully connected output layer using Cross-Entropy Loss to enhance the model's performance. The total loss function is defined as $L_{Total} = L_{CrossEntropy} + L_{Triplet}$. Remarkably, this approach achieved an accuracy of 97.50% on the test set, showcasing the effectiveness of the Triplet Loss in boosting performance.

### End-to-End Training
In this section, the notebook trains the entire model in an end-to-end fashion using both Triplet Loss and Cross-Entropy Loss. The final model achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.05%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the combined losses in improving the model's performance.

**Conclusions:** The exploration of these various transfer learning approaches showcases the significance of different loss functions and training strategies in enhancing the performance of models, particularly when dealing with limited datasets like CIFAR-10.
